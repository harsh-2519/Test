<p>This document addresses many of the requirements in section 4 – “Context of the Organization” in the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard. This includes:</p>
<p>4. Context of the Organization</p>
<p>4.1 Understanding of the organization and its context</p>
<p>4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties</p>
<p>4.3 Determining the scope of the ISMS</p>

<p>If your organization already has ISO9001 certification then much of the contents of this document may already be documented, in which case this information will need to be readily available at the ISO/IEC 27001 audit.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely key document that will need involvement from senior management to put together. In overview, it describes why an effective ISMS is needed and what may happen to the organization if one is not in place. The business impact analyses and risk assessments required by later sections of the standard will then define this in more detail.</p>
<p>As part of the implementation you may need to meet with the various interested parties to understand their view of the risk areas and consequences of failure. You may also need to obtain legal advice if your industry is subject to significant legal or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>As with most of the documents in the ISMS you should ensure that all relevant parties are aware of the contents of this document, particularly as it sets out the need for additional procedures which may involve asking employees to do more work. Understanding the reason for this may reduce resistance to the ISMS within the organization.</p>
<p>It is worth spending some time getting the scope of the ISMS right as the other areas of the standard rely upon this. As with most international standards, it is acceptable to start with a limited scope definition and then to expand it over time as more familiarity and experience is gained by the organization.</p></td>

<p>The ISMS is designed to address the major risks that are identified to the information security of . In identifying, assessing and managing these risks there are a number of options open to the organization according to its appetite for risk.</p>
<p>In general terms the organization’s appetite for risk may be said to be Low/Moderate/High (delete as appropriate).</p>
<p>[Low] The strategy of the organization is to avoid risk where possible and to invest resources in mitigating residual risk through effective information security measures.</p>
<p>[Moderate] The strategy of the organization is to accept reasonable levels of risk whilst making some effort to ensure measures are in place to handle risks if they occur.</p>
<p>[High] The strategy of the organization is to accept significant levels of risk as an integral part of the business it is in, on the basis that the resulting rewards will be sufficient justification.</p>
<p>This general level of risk appetite will be applied to the risk assessments that are carried out as part of the ISMS and will determine the actions that need to be taken to mitigate risk to an acceptable degree.</p>
<p>The criteria for assessing risk in the context of the organization’s appetite for risk are defined in a separate ISMS document <em>Risk Assessment and Treatment Process</em>.</p>
