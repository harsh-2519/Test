a) The context of the organization
b) External and internal issues relevant to the purpose of [Organization Name]
c) Interested parties relevant to the ISMS

This document will be updated at least annually and when significant change happens to the relevant areas covered.

3.3 Risk Appetite

The ISMS is designed to address the major risks that are identified to the information security of [Organization Name]. In identifying, assessing and managing these risks there are a number of options open to the organization according to its appetite for risk.

In general terms the organization’s appetite for risk may be said to be Low/Moderate/High (delete as appropriate).  

[Low] The strategy of the organization is to avoid risk where possible and to invest resources in mitigating residual risk through effective information security measures.

[Moderate] The strategy of the organization is to accept reasonable levels of risk whilst making some effort to ensure measures are in place to handle risks if they occur.

[High] The strategy of the organization is to accept significant levels of risk as an integral part of the business it is in, on the basis that the resulting rewards will be sufficient justification.

This general level of risk appetite will be applied to the risk assessments that are carried out as part of the ISMS and will determine the actions that need to be taken to mitigate risk to an acceptable degree.

The criteria for assessing risk in the context of the organization’s appetite for risk are defined in a separate ISMS document Risk Assessment and Treatment Process.
